改后示例：
- Could I BE any more tired after that meeting?
    -  I know, right? That meeting was endless, and I felt like my brain was melting. I need about ten cups of coffee to recover from that ordeal!
    -  Seriously, I felt like I was in a time loop. Next time, we need to bring snacks and coffee to survive!

- How’s your new job going?
	- It’s going great! I’m learning so much, and my colleagues are really supportive. I feel like I’m finally on the right career path, and it’s so exciting! Every day is a new challenge, and I’m loving the energy of the team. I really feel like I’m growing here.
	- Honestly, it’s been tough. I’m not really enjoying it as much as I hoped. The work is overwhelming, and I’m struggling to find my place in the team.

以下是反例（现在不必修改）

- **Do you ever get tired of working on your computer all day?**    
	- Sometimes, it can be exhausting, especially when things don’t work as expected, but I love the challenge and the satisfaction of solving problems.
	- Not really! I enjoy the challenges and the satisfaction of solving problems, and it keeps me energized throughout the day.

- **Do you ever feel overwhelmed by all the information you try to absorb?**
	- Absolutely, it can be quite overwhelming at times, especially when I’m diving deep into complex topics, but the thrill of understanding something new keeps me going.
	- Sometimes, but I see it as an exciting journey of learning. Each new piece of information is a step towards greater knowledge!

One more question.
你：
What's a favorite childhood memory that you often think about?
我：
When I was at preschool, we held an event of climbing mountains. While other students returned at the half way, my father led me to reach the top, which brought the compliment from my teachers. That experience formed the aspiration and ambition in my personality.
你：
### Refined Answer:
When I was in preschool, we had this mountain climbing event. While the other kids turned back halfway, my dad and I made it all the way to the top. My teachers were so impressed, and that experience really sparked my ambition and drive.

### Personality Type Responses:

**ESFP (Entertainer):**
Oh, when I was in preschool, we had this super fun mountain climbing event. Most of the kids turned back halfway, but my dad and I were like, "Let’s go for it!" and we made it to the top! My teachers were totally impressed, and it was such a blast. That moment really made me love adventure and dreaming big.

**ENFP (Campaigner):**
Oh wow, when I was in preschool, we had this totally awesome mountain climbing event! Most of the kids turned back halfway, but my dad and I were like, "Let’s do this!" and we totally made it to the top! My teachers were so impressed, and it was just the best time ever. That moment really sparked my love for adventure and dreaming big.

**ISTP (Virtuoso):**
Back in preschool, we had a mountain climbing event. Most of the kids turned back halfway, but my dad and I decided to keep going. We reached the top, and my teachers were impressed. It was a great experience and it made me appreciate adventure and setting big goals.

### Refined Responses:

1. High school felt like it was designed to wear us out, both physically and mentally. I barely made any real connections, so after graduation, I felt kind of lost.
2. Honestly, I didn’t stay in touch with anyone. I was in this super intense STEM class, where everyone either went off to STEM colleges or kept to themselves because of how the class was set up.
3. But honestly, as long as I was wrapped up in something I enjoyed, none of that really got to me.

### Personality Type Responses:

**ESFP (Entertainer):**

1. High school was like a total grind! It seemed like they just wanted to drain us. I didn’t really make any close friends, so after graduation, I felt pretty lost.
2. Nah, I didn’t stay in touch with anyone. My class was all about STEM, and people either went off to STEM schools or we just didn’t connect because of the way things were.
3. But honestly, as long as I was having fun with something I loved, nothing else really got to me.

**ENFP (Campaigner):**

1. High school? Ugh, it was such a weird mix of feeling totally drained and kind of alone. I didn’t really connect with many people, so when I graduated, I felt pretty empty.
2. I didn’t keep in touch with anyone. I was in this crazy intense STEM class, and people either headed to STEM colleges or we just didn’t talk much because the class was so divided.
3. But honestly, when I was into something I loved, I was in my own little world, and nothing else really mattered.

**ISTP (Virtuoso):**

1. High school was such a grind. It felt like they were just trying to wear us down. I didn’t make many close friends, so after graduation, it was kind of lonely.
2. I didn’t really stay in touch with anyone. My STEM class was pretty intense, and people either went off to STEM schools or kept to themselves because of how things were set up.
3. But honestly, as long as I was doing something I enjoyed, none of that other stuff really got to me.

**Lily (Duolingo character):**

1. High school was like being on a never-ending treadmill, honestly. I didn’t make many real connections, so after graduation, I felt pretty lost.
2. I didn’t really keep in touch with anyone. My STEM class was pretty intense, and most people either went off to STEM schools or just kept to themselves because of the way things were set up.
3. But honestly, as long as I was doing something I loved, I didn’t really let anything else bother me.

### Refined Responses:

1. “Definitely! The color looks amazing on you, and you’ll totally turn heads with that blouse. You’ve got great taste. Also, I spotted another blouse that might look great on you—want to try it on?”

2. “Glad you like the idea! But now we have a bit of a problem—our budget might not cover both blouses, or we’d have to give up something else. We should make a decision.”

3. “That makes sense. Why don’t you try both on and see which one you like better?”

4. “Alright. What’s the next step?”

5. “Sorry, what do you mean by that?”

6. “I’m afraid we’re running out of time—it’s already 8 p.m. Maybe we should head home. By the way, you look absolutely stunning in that blouse. I’m really happy for you!”

### Personality Type Responses:

**ESFP (Entertainer):**

1. “Oh, for sure! That color is going to look so good on you—you’ll definitely turn heads. You’ve got awesome taste. And hey, I spotted another blouse that might be perfect for you. Want to try it on?”

2. “I’m so glad you like it! But we’ve got a bit of a problem—our budget might not cover both blouses unless we skip something else we wanted. We should figure this out.”

3. “Totally agree. Why not try them both on and see which one feels best?”

4. “Okay, what’s next on our list?”

5. “Wait, what do you mean by that?”

6. “Uh-oh, time’s running out—it’s already 8 p.m. We should probably head home. But wow, you look absolutely stunning in that blouse! I’m so happy for you!”

**ENFP (Campaigner):**

1. “Oh, absolutely! That color is going to look amazing on you—you’ll be the center of attention for sure. You’ve got such a great eye for fashion. Also, I noticed another blouse that might look perfect on you. Want to check it out?”

2. “Yay! But here’s the thing—we might need to choose because our budget won’t cover both blouses, unless we let go of something else we love. Let’s figure it out!”

3. “Good idea! Try them both on, and see which one feels more like you.”

4. “Alrighty, what’s next?”

5. “Oops, I didn’t catch that—what do you mean?”

6. “Oh no, time flies! It’s already 8 p.m. We should probably head out. By the way, you look absolutely gorgeous in that blouse—I’m so thrilled for you!”

**ISTP (Virtuoso):**

1. “Definitely. That color suits you really well, and it’ll definitely get some attention. You’ve got a good eye. Also, I saw another blouse that might work for you. Want to try it?”

2. “I’m glad you’re into it. But here’s the thing—our budget might not stretch to both blouses unless we skip something else. We should make a call.”

3. “Sounds good. Try them both on and see which one feels right.”

4. “Okay, what’s next?”

5. “Sorry, can you clarify that?”

6. “We’re running out of time—it’s already 8 p.m. We should probably head home. By the way, that blouse looks great on you. I’m happy you found something you like.”

**Lily (Duolingo character):**

1. “Totally! That color is going to look amazing on you—you’ll definitely catch people’s attention. You’ve got great taste. Oh, and I saw another blouse that might look perfect on you. Want to try it?”

2. “Glad you like it! But, uh-oh, we might need to choose—our budget won’t cover both blouses unless we give up something else we wanted. What should we do?”

3. “Yeah, that makes sense. Try them both on and see which one you like more.”

4. “Alright, what’s next?”

5. “Wait, what do you mean?”

6. “Oh no, it’s already 8 p.m.—time’s almost up! We should probably head home. But hey, that blouse looks amazing on you—I’m really happy for you!”
